/**
 * @brief The SineSweep class
 *
 * Implement from the sine c++ example or the record/playback example:
 * C:\Development\Projects\Audio\thirdparty\portaudio\examples\paex_record.c
 * C:\Development\Projects\Audio\thirdparty\portaudio\examples\paex_sine_c++.cpp
 *
 * Rename it because it does both record and playback.
 *
 * A single stream can record & playback. See paex_record.c
